DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
This is a clustering algorithm (an alternative to K-Means) that clusters points together
and identifies any points not belonging to a cluster as outliers.


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv (r'C:\Users\aman.saxena\Desktop\Book2.csv')
dataset = df['height'].values.reshape(-1,1)
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
outlier_detection = DBSCAN(
 eps = .2, 
 #metric='euclidean', 
 min_samples = 5,
 n_jobs = -1)
clusters = outlier_detection.fit_predict(dataset)
print(clusters)

output:-
values having -1 is outlier
[-1 -1 -1 -1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1 -1 -1 -1]
